# About
This repository is a Spring Boot demo app that can be deployed to various PaaS. In the "deployment" folder you can find scripts for deploying the application to Cloud Foundry, 
OpenShift, Heroku and Google App Engine. They also create services and bind them to the app. 
These scripts will not work for you without replacing some placeholders and adapting the commands according to your exact environment.

I used the app to discuss its deployment in blog posts and articles. If you are interested in this topic, please
